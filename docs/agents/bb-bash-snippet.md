## Bitbucket via bb-bash

**Tool:** `bbb` (project `bb-bash`, https://github.com/restarter/bb-bash)
**Install** (if not present):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restarter/bb-bash/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Auto-resolves through symlinks; `.env` lives next to the real script (`~/.local/share/bb-bash/.env` after `install.sh`).

**Auto-detects** workspace/repo from this repo's bitbucket.org remote.
**Auth:** `BB_BASH_EMAIL` + `BB_BASH_TOKEN` in `~/.local/share/bb-bash/.env`. Create the token at https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens with scopes:

- `read:repository:bitbucket`
- `read:pullrequest:bitbucket`
- `write:pullrequest:bitbucket`
- `read:pipeline:bitbucket` *(optional, for `pr checks` Pipelines)*

### Common workflows

```bash
# List PRs
bbb pr list                              # open PRs (default)
bbb pr list --state=merged --author=alice

# Inspect a PR
bbb pr show <id>
bbb pr diff <id>
bbb pr comments <id>
bbb pr checks <id>                       # CI + pipelines status

# Comment / review
bbb pr comment <id> "general comment"
bbb pr inline <id> path/to/file 42 "comment on new code"
bbb pr inline --old <id> path/to/file 10 "comment on deleted code"
bbb pr reply <pr_id> <comment_id> "reply text"
bbb pr edit-comment <pr_id> <comment_id> "updated text"     # own comments only
bbb pr delete-comment <pr_id> <comment_id>                  # own comments only

# Approve / decline / merge
bbb pr approve <id> [<id> ...]           # batch-capable
bbb pr decline <id> [<id> ...]           # batch-capable
bbb pr merge <id> [--squash|--commit|--ff] [--delete-branch]

# Create / update
bbb pr create <target_branch> "Title" "Description"
bbb pr update <id> --title="New title" --description="..."

# Browser escape hatch
bbb pr open <id>
```

### For AI agents (review patterns)

When reviewing a PR:

1. `bbb pr show <id>` — title, author, changed files
2. `bbb pr diff <id> | head -200` — read the diff
3. `bbb pr checks <id>` — confirm CI status before approving
4. `bbb pr inline <id> <path> <line> "feedback"` — inline review comments
5. `bbb pr approve <id>` or `bbb pr comment <id> "summary"` to wrap up

For batch operations (close stale PRs, approve multiple):

```bash
bbb pr decline 65 67 89
bbb pr approve 12 15 18
```

### Conventions

- **Line numbers** in `pr inline` refer to actual file line numbers, NOT diff line numbers.
- **Inline mode** — `pr inline` for new/modified code (`to:<line>` payload), `pr inline --old` for deleted/old code (`from:<line>` payload).
- **Edit/delete** — Bitbucket only allows editing/deleting your own comments. A 403 from another user's comment is expected, don't retry. `pr edit-comment` is a **full-body replace** (REST PUT), not a patch — pass the complete new text.
- **Multi-line content** — pass via single-quoted heredoc (`<<'EOF'`) to preserve newlines AND prevent variable / command substitution. Don't pre-escape `\$` or `` \` `` inside `<<'EOF'` — they pass through as literal `\$` and `` \` ``, which is rarely what you want.

  ```bash
  bbb pr comment 42 "$(cat <<'EOF'
  Multi-line; $vars and `cmds` stay literal here.
  EOF
  )"
  ```

- **Force-push effect** — Bitbucket Cloud marks inline comments as "outdated" when the referenced line changes; the comment is preserved (not removed). After a force-push, re-post on the new line rather than relying on the stale one.
- **Before approve** — run `git fetch && git log <previous-approve-ref>..HEAD` to see if commits landed after your last review. Some repos have "Reset approvals on new commits" enabled (auto-dismiss); others don't — when in doubt, redo the review.
- **Comment markdown** — Bitbucket Cloud uses Python-Markdown. Supported: fenced code blocks with language (`` ```php ``), tables (pipe syntax), strikethrough (`~~text~~`), lists, links, blockquotes, mentions (`@accountname` or `@email`). **HTML tags are NOT supported.** Full reference: https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/markup-comments/
- **Blank line before lists** — Python-Markdown needs a blank line between a text line and a following list (or table/heading). A list placed directly under a `**Heading:**` lead-in is parsed as a lazy continuation of that paragraph and renders as one run-on line. The API still returns 201 and the raw source looks fine, so the break is invisible until the PR is opened. Always leave a blank line before a list.

### When NOT to use bb-bash

- GitHub PRs — use `gh` CLI instead.
- Bitbucket Server (self-hosted) — bb-bash targets Bitbucket **Cloud** only.
- Workspace / repo / user administration — out of scope; use the Bitbucket web UI.
- Pending / draft / "Start review" batched comments — Bitbucket API publishes immediately; web UI only.
